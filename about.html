    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m Rahat, a passionate and curious learner with a deep interest in technology, design, and the mysteries of the universe. Ever since I encountered my first computer, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by how things work behind the screen. What started as a hobby quickly turned into a lifelong passion for digital creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey began with the basics: HTML and CSS. I still remember the joy of building my first web page â€” a simple layout, a heading, and a little splash of color. From that moment, I was hooked. As I continued to learn, I explored graphic design using tools like Canva, Photoshop, and Figma. I enjoyed turning ideas into visuals that could communicate, inspire, and solve problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, I ventured into JavaScript, and it opened up a whole new world of interactivity. Whether it's dark mode toggles, animation, form validation, or mini projects, I began building not just websites â€” but experiences. Learning Git and GitHub also helped me manage my work like a professional.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in learning by doing. I spend my time creating, exploring new tools, and pushing the limits of my understanding. My focus is not just on how things look, but also how they work â€” and how they make users feel. I believe good design is invisible yet impactful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the screen, Iâ€™m a space science enthusiast. I love reading about black holes, rocket launches, the James Webb Telescope, and the wonders beyond our planet. Space inspires me to think big, stay humble, and keep dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope to combine my love for technology and science into something meaningful. My goal is to create tools, platforms, or ideas that not only work â€” but help people, empower them, and maybe even change the world in small ways.
