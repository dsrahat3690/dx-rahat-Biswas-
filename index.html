    <h2>My Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I am Rahat, a student who finds meaning in technology and creativity. Each day is a new story of learning for me. Ever since I touched a computer for the first time, I knewâ€”this is my world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe technology isn't just about solving problems, itâ€™s also about improving lives. My journey began with a simple webpage displaying my name. Today, Iâ€™m building my own website to share my story, my dreams, and my passion for learning.

    <h2>My Learning Journey</h2>
    <p>
      I started with HTML and CSSâ€”thatâ€™s where my love for digital creation began. Later, I became interested in graphic design and started creating posters, banners, and logos using Canva, Figma, and Photoshop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, I explored JavaScript to build interactive websites. Dark mode toggles, sliders, calculatorsâ€”each little project added to my confidence. I also learned how to use GitHub and manage code versions like a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm exploring advanced tools like React and Tailwind to take my skills further. Learning has become a habitâ€”and I don't intend to stop.

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>
      My dream is to become a skilled full-stack web developer who not only writes code but uses it to make a real difference. I hope to build a tech company that helps students learn easily and creatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m also passionate about space science. I love reading about NASA, SpaceX, and the James Webb Space Telescope. One day, I wish to connect technology and space research in a meaningful way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that every new idea opens a door to a new creationâ€”and Iâ€™m walking through that door every single day.
