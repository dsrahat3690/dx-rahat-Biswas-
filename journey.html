    <h2>The Journey of My Life</h2>
    <p>
      I am Rahat, a student passionate about technology and creativity. From an early age, I had a strong desire to learn new things. My love for technology began the first time I touched a computer â€” from that moment, a unique bond was formed between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started learning with HTML and CSS. Creating simple web pages, changing colors, writing my name â€” those small things brought me great joy. Later, I found interest in graphic design and started designing posters, banners, and logos using Canva, Figma, and Photoshop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, I entered the world of JavaScript and realized how a static page could become interactive. Creating calculators, dark mode toggles, and sliders gave me more confidence and inspiration to build more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, Iâ€™m exploring web design and development more deeply, and Iâ€™m also deeply interested in space science. I love reading about NASA, SpaceX, and the James Webb Telescope. One day, I hope to become a full-stack developer and a tech-loving space explorer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I truly believe that learning never stops. Every day I try to gain something new and push myself one step forward toward my dreams.
